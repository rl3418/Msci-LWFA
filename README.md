# Msci-LWFA
This respository is associated with the PLAS-Najmudin-1 MSci project at Imperial College London. 
It concerns the evolution of the plasma channel driven by OFI.
Smilei code was used to analyse the ionisation process, and an example namelist can be found in the respository.
FLASH code was used to simulate the expansion process, and the folder in the repository is the problem folder written for the simulations.
